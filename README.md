## Project overview
The goal of the project is to allow golf course owners/managers to draw the shape of their
courses using a web application. Details such as the location of the hole and any natural
hazards can also be included in the map of the course.

Players on the course should then be able to use a mobile application to see the map of the
course and where they are on it currently. This will allow the players to plan their shots more
strategically.

## Build instructions

Make sure that you have Angular CLI 6 installed. To build the project, use the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/team-recursive-recursion/web-app.git
cd web-app
npm install
ng serve --port 80
```
You can then connect to the website on `http://localhost`.
